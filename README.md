# Ferty

Ferty is a keyboard layout similar to the us layout with modifications to enable easy typing of finnish language, which requires single press access to ä and ö. Ferty is a fork of [Swerty](http://johanegustafsson.net/projects/swerty/).

## Differencies to Swerty

- Brackets and braces are placed exactly as in the us layout
- No Å
- AltGr is used instead of Alt R (i thought this was the idea in Swerty as well, but i had to add it to get it work)
- Apostrophe, double quotation mark, semicolon and colon are accessed by AltGr+{a,s,d,f} respectively
